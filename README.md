this is just an outline of an app, it has not been finished. I just wanted to use some of the latest technologies like es6, however, I didn't have enough time to finish it,


if you enter this in the browser it will open the app (http://localhost:8000/) 
it runs with npm start and requires npm install as well, however it is not finished, just an outline of a code that is in very early stages.
